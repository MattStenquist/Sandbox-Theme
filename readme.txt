This is a D.I.Y Wordpress - Blog Theme.

It's a super simple theme that's built up with the main loop and the main nav is synced up. 
All you have to do is fork this / download this and keep building the single.php, and
whatever you desire.

This theme is called "sandbox" as it's a theme that isn't fully built.
